      <h3>Week ‚úåÔ∏è</h3>
      <p>
         Week two was an informative one. Heavy in reading content. I am ejoying learning new things.  I dont uderstand everything we are goiing over quite yet, but I'm learning a lot. One thing i wish i could do but cannot as of yet back end web development. Something I wish that I understood better is JavaScript. Some methods that i am usuing right now to solve problems are web searches, Youtube videos. Sometimes I do something else like play a game or take a walk for a while to clear my head then come back to the task.

 Skills learned this week:
    <ul>
        <li> HTML </li>
        <li> CSS </li>
        <li> JavaScript </li>
        <li> Agile </li>
        <li> Chrrome Dev Tools </li>
        <li> Retrospectives</li>
    </ul>
        </p>

    <div class="col shadow p-3 mb-5 bg-body rounded">
      <h3>Week ü§ü</h3>
      <p>
          Week three was a lot more HTML CSS & JavaScript. 
          I more fully understand how HTML set the order of the page, and the way to grab a section of the code 
          to change it in a coding language. CSS is something that I enjoy doing styling the page is very enjoyable
           to me. JavaScrit has been my main challenge so far. 
           I am working on it. I have began to do "extra" work to understand it better. I'm remaining inspired.
    <br>
    Elon Musk said:<br>
        "When something is important enough, you do it even if the odds are not in your favor."
     <br>
        " Here's a tremendous bias against taking risks. Everyone is trying to optimize their ass-covering."
    <br>
I have not yet begun to incorporate pseudocode yet, but look forward to starting to do so next week.

What I learned this week:
<ul>
 <li> Debugging with Chrome Dev tools.</li>
 <li> JavaScript.</li>
 <li> JavaScript in Dev Tools.</li>

    some of the same isssues it made my able to relax and have a better prespective.</li>

    <li> Using the refrences provided in the materials.</li>

      <h3>Week ‚úã‚òùÔ∏è</h3>
      <p>
          Week 6 was a pretty good week for me personally. I was able to manage time a ittle more properly. We worked on a contact card that we built off 
          of a wireframe. It was to share our info quickly with a client or peer. It was mostly an exercise in bootstrap. we also had a project making a 
          weather forecast app. Working with the other bootcampers and asking more quexstions seems to be the key to my success at this point.<br>
          Things i learned this week include:
        <ul>
              <li>Axios to handle Api</li>
              <li>Json to handle axios/API</li>
              <li>JavaScript caliing API/ handling the resutls</li>
              <li>Bootstrap (more)</li>
              <li>how to hide/show elements.</li>
