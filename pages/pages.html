                    I had been preparing for HTML &a CSS. I am excited to learn more about mastering Github, along with
                    markdown.
                    These two things are completely new to me. I will also be very excited to learn about styling this

                    Week two was an informative one. This week was heavy in reading content. I am ejoying learning new
                    things. I don't
                    uderstand everything we are going over quite yet, but I am learning a lot. One thing I wish I could
                    do but cannot as of yet back end web development. Something I wish that I understood better is
                    JavaScript. Some methods that I am using right now to solve problems are web searches, Youtube
                    videos. Sometimes I do something else like play a game or take a walk for a while to clear my head
                    then come back to the task.<br>

                    Week three was a lot more HTML CSS & JavaScript.
                    I more fully understand how HTML set the order of the page, and the way to grab a section of the
                    code
                    to change it in a coding language. CSS is something that I enjoy doing styling the page is very
                    enjoyable
                    to me. JavaScrit has been my main challenge so far.
                    I am working on it. I have began to do "extra" work to understand it better. I'm remaining inspired.

                <b>Things that were helpful during Onboarding:</b><br>

                Learning more about the history of computer science.<br>
                Learning git & github.<br>
                Learning resources for anwers to our coding problems.<br>
                The instructional videos are what I found most helpful.(The videos by our instrustors.)<br>
                <b>Daily Stand-ups.<br></b>

                Many times I was feeling overwhelmed, however, when I saw peers strugling with
                some of the same issues as myself, it made me able to relax and have a better prespective.<br>
                <b>Demo Day.<br></b>

                I learned so much just from other problems that others had solved and creative
                solutions
                to things that I didnt think of while working on my own project.

                <br>
                <b>Things that hindered my progress during Onboarding:<br></b>

                Family obligations.<br>
                Children in the house, noisey enviroment. (they tried).<br>
                Lots of reading without group practicing or leasons from instructors.<br>
                Lack of knowledge when it comes to even basic coding skills.

                <br>

                <b>How I overcame challenges during Onboarding:<br></b>

                Rewatching videos from my instructors when applicable.<br>
                Using the refrences provided in the materials.<br>
                GOOGLE<br>
                Sometimes walking away from a current issue and doing something non code related for a few

                first time ( Katas). We worked on a campaign website that was for a fictional character.
                Mine was for Jon Snow. We also did a JavaScript project called Mind Reader.<br>

                Week six was a pretty good week for me personally. I was able to manage time a little more
                appropriately . We worked on a contact card that we built off
                of a wireframe. The contact card was to share our info quickly with a client or peer. The project was
                mostly an
                exercise in bootstrap. We also had a project making a
                weather forecast app. Working with the other bootcampers and asking more quexstions seems to be
                the key to my success at this point.<br>

    <h6 class="card-subtitle mb-2 text-muted">O.O.P. | Pseudocode | MVC </h6>
    <p class="card-text">
        <b>Pseudocode</b><br>
        Pseudocode is my process of writing code in an "english" form. Code in an easily readable form.
        Pseudocode should be used to define the functionality, objects, functions, classes, and variables
        that will be needed to construct my webpage.<br>
        <b>Pseudocode</b> in OOP is helpful for me to work from "the outside, in". Setting Classes then moving
        "in" to variables, functions, helper functions, objects, and properties is a great structure form 
        to work through my functionality, and establish the process of my webpage.<br>
        <b>Singleton</b> design pattern means there is only one instance of a class. Often, State Objects 
        are a Singleton instead of glabal to cut down of confusion when many global items will be used.
        This is abetter structured way of programming when it is applicable. By declaring the constructors of a 
        class private this implements a "container" for defined access to that class. clearing up space in the global
        are for only those items necessary.
