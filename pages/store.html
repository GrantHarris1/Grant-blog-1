<p> Week one <em>was not</em> what I expected. We dove straight into Git &amp; Github and I had been preparing for HTML &amp; CSS. I am excited to learn more about mastering Github, along with markdown. These two things are completely new to me. I will also be very excited to learn about styling this blog. One thing about me personally is <a href="https://kentuckysportsradio.com">K.S.R.</a> is my favorite website. I am excited for my opportunity in this class, to have a new valuable skill. Some things I learned in week one:</p>
<ul>
<li>Codeanywhere<ul>
<li>Text Editing</li>
<li>Markdown language</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Grasshopper<ul>

<p>Week two was an informative one. Heavy in reading content. I am enjoying learning new things.  I don&#39;t understand everything we are going over quite yet, but I&#39;m learning a lot. One thing I wish I could do but cannot as of yet back end web development. Something I wish that I understood better is JavaScript. Some methods that I am using right now to solve problems are web searches, Youtube videos. Sometimes I do something else like play a game or take a walk for a while to clear my head then come back to the task.</p>

<p>Week three was a lot more HTML CSS &amp; JavaScript. I more fully understand how HTML sets the order of the page and the way to grab a section of the code to change it in a coding language. CSS is something that I enjoy doing styling the page is very enjoyable to me. javascript has been my main challenge so far. I am working on it. I have begun to do &quot;extra&quot; work to understand it better. I&#39;m remaining inspired.</p>

<p><img src="/blog/img/balls.png" alt="no balls"></p>
<p>Things that were helpful during Onboarding:</p>
<ol>
<li>Learning more about the history of computer science.</li>
<li>Learning git &amp; GitHub.</li>
<li>Learning resources for answers to our coding problems.</li>
<li>The instructional videos were what I found most helpful( the videos by our instructors.)</li>
<li>Daily Stand-ups. Many times I was feeling overwhelmed, and when I saw peers struggling with some of the same issues it made me able to relax and have a better perspective.</li>
<li>Demo Day. I learned so much just from other problems that others had solved and creative solutions to things that I didn&#39;t think of while working on my own project.
<br>
<br>
Things that hindered my progress during Onboarding:</li>
<li>Family obligations.</li>
<li>Children in the house (they tried).</li>
<li>Lots of reading without group practicing or lessons from instructors.</li>
<li>Lack of knowledge when it comes to even basic coding skills.
<br>
<br>
How I overcame challenges during Onboarding:</li>
<li>Rewatching videos from my instructors when applicable. (preferred method).</li>
<li>Using the references provided in the materials.</li>
<li>GOOGLE</li>
<li>Sometimes walking away from a current issue and doing something non-code-related for a few minutes and coming back to it with a clear mind.</li>
</ol>
</li>
