####Grants Awesome Journey
## Week One
<br>
<p>Week one was not what i expected. we dove straight into Git & Github and I had been preparing for HTML & CSS.
 
 I am excited to learn more about mastering Github, along with markdown. These two things are completley new to me. I will also be very excited to learn about styling this blog.

 Only by reading this blog you would learn that I am in serveral lawn care workers groups online because they are so funny and very mean to each other. I get bored.
