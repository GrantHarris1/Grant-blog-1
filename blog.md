 Week one *was not* what I expected. We dove straight into Git & Github and I had been preparing for HTML & CSS. I am excited to learn more about mastering Github, along with markdown. These two things are completley new to me. I will also be very excited to learn about styling this blog. One thing about me personally is [K.S.R.](https://kentuckysportsradio.com) is my favorite website. I am excited for my opportunity in this class, to have a new valuable skill. Some things I learned in week one:
