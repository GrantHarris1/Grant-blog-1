<p>Week one was not what i expected. we dove straight into Git & Github and I had been preparing for HTML & CSS.
  I am excited to learn more about mastering Github, along with markdown. These two things are completley new to me. I will also be very excited to learn about styling this blog.I am excited for my opportunity in the class, to have a new valuable skill.</p>
