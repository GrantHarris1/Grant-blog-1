 Week one *was not* what I expected. We dove straight into Git & Github and I had been preparing for HTML & CSS. I am excited to learn more about mastering Github, along with markdown. These two things are completley new to me. I will also be very excited to learn about styling this blog. One thing about me personally is [K.S.R.](https://kentuckysportsradio.com) is my favorite website. I am excited for my opportunity in this class, to have a new valuable skill. Some things I learned in week one:
* Codeanywhere
  * Text Editing
  * Markdown language
* Grasshopper
  * Fundamentals
  * Fundamentals II
* Git
  * How to start a new repository.
  * Commands such as push, pull, add , etc.
  * How to merge branches.
* Github
  * How to montior your branches in Git

### Week ‚úåÔ∏è

Week two was an informative one. Heavy in reading content. I am ejoying learning new things.  I dont uderstand everything we are goiing over quite yet, but I'm learning a lot. One thing i wish i could do but cannot as of yet back end web development. Something I wish that I understood better is JavaScript. Some methods that i am usuing right now to solve problems are web searches, Youtube videos. Sometimes I do something else like play a game or take a walk for a while to clear my head then come back to the task.

Skills learned so far:

Week‚òùÔ∏è|Week‚úåÔ∏è
-----|-----
Code Anywhere| Html,CSS,JavaScript
Grasshopper Fundamentals| Agile
Git|Chrome Dev Tools
Github|Retrospectives

### Week ü§ü

Week three was a lot more HTML CSS & JavaScript. I more fully understand how HTML set the order of the page, and the way to grab a section of the code to change it in a coding language. CSS is something that I enjoy doing styling the page is very enjoyable to me. JavaScrit has been my main challenge so far. i am working on it. I have began to do "extra" work to understand it better. I'm remaining inspired.

I have not yet begun to incorporate pseudocode yet, but look forward to starting to do so next week.

  Things that were helpful during Onboarding:
1. Learning more about the history of computer science.
2. Learning git & github.
3. Learning resources for anwers to our coding problems.
4. The instructional videos were what i found most helpful( the videos by our instrustors.)
5. Daily Stand-ups. Many times i was feeling overwhelmed, and when I saw peers strugling with some of the same isssues it made my able to relax and have a better prespective.
6. Demo Day. I learned so much just from other problems that others had solved and creative solutions to things that I didnt think of while working on my own project.
<br>
<br>
Things that hindered my progress during Onboarding:
* Family obligations.
* Children in the house (they tried).
* Lots of reading without group practicing or leasons from instructors.
* Lack of knowledge when it comes to even basic coding skills.
<br>
<br>
How I overcame challenges during Onboarding:
1. Rewatching videos from my instructors when applicable. (perferred method).
2. Using the refrences provided in the materials.
3. GOOGLE
4. Sometimes walking away from a current issue and doing something non code related for a few minutes and coming back to it with a clear mind.
